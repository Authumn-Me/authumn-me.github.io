## whoami

I’ve always been curious about how systems behave once they’re actually in use. Not in ideal lab setups, but in real environments where defaults linger, documentation is only half-read, and small decisions quietly compound over time.

That curiosity gradually pulled me towards security, and towards looking at Windows and cloud environments from an attacker’s point of view. I tend to focus on the details that are easy to overlook: legacy behaviour, identity-related quirks, remote access technologies, and the traces systems leave behind long after an action has taken place.

In my day-to-day work as a penetration tester, I run into these kinds of issues on a regular basis. Many of them aren’t exotic or new; they’re patterns that keep showing up across different environments. This blog is a place to write about those recurring findings: why they exist, how they’re commonly abused, and what actually helps to mitigate them in practice.

Some posts focus on concrete attack techniques, others on defensive blind spots or mitigations that don’t behave the way people expect them to. The common thread is understanding *why* something works the way it does, rather than just documenting a single isolated issue.

There isn’t a large archive here yet, but the plan is to keep adding write-ups over time. If you’re interested in Windows or Azure security, practical attack paths, and real-world observations that show up again and again, you’ll probably find something useful here.
