&lt;p&gt;Remote Desktop has been a standard tool for system administrators and anyone who needs to manage a server or workstation from a distance for many years. During a session far more happens behind the scenes than most people realise. Windows quietly stores small fragments of the remote screen, a mechanism known as the RDP Bitmap Cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many users assume that once an RDP session is closed, anything that appeared on the screen disappears as well. In reality a portion of that visual data remains on the local machine. Forensic investigators consider this a valuable source of information, and in security-focused environments it is important to understand what this cache contains, how it works and which risks it introduces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
